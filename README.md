Project for Oracle + Alura-Latam Programming Course. 

Introduction:

Learning project for the Programming Course provided by Oracle + Alura Latam.

The project consists of creating a text encryption program with JavaScript. In turn, once the logic of the program is finished, the structure of the page will take place with HTML and give it life with CSS. Frameworks will not be used in this project.

The instructions to go along with are: The encryption "keys" that are required to use are the following:

The letter "e" is converted to "enter"
The letter "i" is converted to "imes"
The letter "a" is converted to "ai"
The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"

Extra requirements:
- It work only with lowercase letters
- Letters with accents or special characters should not be used
- It should be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version as well as return an encrypted word to its original version.

E.g:

"gato" => "gaitober"
gaitober" => "gato"

The page must have fields for
insertion of the text to be encrypted or decrypted, and the user must be able to choose between the two options.
The result should be displayed on the screen.
Additional features:
- A button that copies the encrypted/decrypted text for the transfer section, that is, it has the same functionality as ctrl+C or the "copy" option from the applications menu.

It should be noted that for the organization of the project, work will be done with Trello and with Figma (the latter, if necessary by the programmer).
